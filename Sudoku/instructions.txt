In sudoku the game is based around a value "n".
This variable n defines the size of the board.
The board is composed of boxes, rows, and columns, which can each be split into cells
The board is a n^2 by n^2 board, each row is n^2 long, each column is n^2 tall, and each box is n by n making n^2 cells in each box.
You start the board with some given numbers that are within the range of 1 to n^2.
You solve the board by filling in numbers according to the rules of sudoku.
The rules are the you cannot place two numbers in the same cell, the board must be filled out to win, and you must obey the "one rule".
The one rule states that each box, row, and column must contain the numbers 1 through n^2.
Normally sudoku is played with an n of 3 but my game is based around an n of 2.
However, some functions in my code work for both an n of 3 and 2.
*0s represent empty cells in my game
*you press f6 to begin

Example:
n = 3

board length = 9
box size = 3 by 3
column height = 9
row length = 9
